# BRSTR - Bridge Structure
*This repo has been moved from the original wisib server to github*

The ontology for Bridge Structure (BRSTR) allows the definition of load bearing components (`brstr:BridgeLoadBearingElement`) and the division into spans (`brstr:BridgeSpan`). Furthermore, the load transmission can be defined through object properties. By using the data property (`brstr:degreeOfFreedom`), various degrees of Freedom for movement and rotation could be assigned to supportive components such as bearings.

The namespace for BRSTR terms is `https://w3id.org/brstr#`

The suggested prefix for the BRSTR namespace is `brstr`

It is recommended to use BRSTR in conjunction with BROT for defining a bridge construction and its aggregated components.
