<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <span>The ontology for Bridge Structure (BRSTR) allows the definition of load bearing components (<a href="#BridgeLoadBearingElement">brstr:BridgeLoadBearingElement</a>) and the division into spans (<a href="#BridgeSpan">brstr:BridgeSpan</a>). Furthermore, the load transmission can be defined through object properties. By using the data property (<a href="#degreeOfFreedom">brstr:degreeOfFreedom</a>) various degrees of Freedom for movement and rotation could be assigned to supportive components such as bearings.</span>

    The namespace for BRSTR terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">https://w3id.org/brstr#</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The suggested prefix for the BRSTR namespace is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">brstr</span>

  <span class="markdown">It is recommended to use BRSTR in conjunction with BROT for defining a bridge construction and its aggregated components.</span>
